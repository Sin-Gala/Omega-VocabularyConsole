# Omega-VocabularyConsole

## Summary
 
## What is Omega-VocabularyConsole ?
Omega-VocabularyConsole (name in working progress) is a simple console application written in C# allowing you to save word translations, synonyms and small definitions easily in as many languages you wish. This is a simple project allowing me to test new things and to improve my programming skills. 


## How to use it ?
### User
The first time you'll use Omega-VocabularyConsole you'll be prompted to add a first language in which you wish your words to be in. You will then be redirected to the menu where you'll be able to follow simple instructions to add and remove languages, as well as add/remove/edit individual word. Multiple search functions are also available (search by word, by synonym, by first letter, and by language).
Everything is saved in two separate files on your computer: a vocabulary.omega that contains the word you saved and which you can easily edit to add/remove/modify words in bulk, and a dictionnary.omega that contains a simple list of the languages you added.
